# Machine_Learning_19_Projects_collection
This collection contains my complete set of Machine Learning projects, covering classification, regression, NLP, recommendation systems, and predictive modeling. The goal of these projects is to build strong end-to-end practical skills—starting from data cleaning and visualization to model building, evaluation, and deployment-ready workflows.
